# CS-300-Data-Structures-and-Analysis

In this course, we completed two projects for ABC University (ABCU). ABCU's Computer Science department wants to create a new software to help advisors view course information for their studednts. They want the ability to view all courses, view associated prerequisites, and search for individual courses.

I approached the problem by first creating pseudocode for different datastructures, such as vectors, binary search trees, and hash tables. Data structures are generally important to understand because they are a foundational part to most things that developers create. Without properly storing information - whether it be in a single variable or a tree - there is no way to transform it into something we can use to solve the problem.

Roadblocks were overcome by constantly referencing reading material, notes, and articles/videos from experienced developers. Taking into account the feedback from my professor was a great help as well since that feedback is finetuned to each assignment I submit.

This work has expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by helping me become more comfortable with structures outside of the ones I was most comfortable with. I learned to differentiate between which structures were more suited to the goal at hand, rather than forcing everything into an array and getting unexpected run times.
Working on this project has helped me to become better at writing solid pseudocode. I have a better understanding as to what good pseudocode is versus too technical pseudocode. I also understand how to reuse certain algorithms in tandem with one another to create a specific result.
